Exercise 1.1:
Review the documentation for your compiler and determine what file naming convention it uses. Compile and run the main program from page 2

Exercise 1.2:
Change the program to return -1. A return value of -1 is often treated as an indicator that the program failed. However, systems vary as to how (or even whether) they report a failure from main. Recompile and rerun your program to see how your system treats a failure indicator from main.
